# Face-Recognition-Using-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a powerful tool for features extraction as well dimensionality reduction. To avoid the problem of small sample size in which the sample size is smaller than the dimension, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied first to reduce the dimension followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis.

You can find the attached training and testing data set in imglq (zipped) folder along with the python code for the above algorithm. 
Accuracy achieved is between 50-60%.
